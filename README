I've got wonderful suffix tree by Sébastien Ferre <ferre@irisa.fr>, and quickly realized that they're GSTs, but only over 
regular character strings.  I am using them with sensor data where observations are generally integer sequences.  Thus
I went ahead and generalized the module, renaming is suffix.ml, and the functor is now Tree.

An example of an alphabet is intseq.ml, where Intseq is defined as an integer alphabet and its strings are int arrays.

An example of testing from the toplevel is intest.ml.

Let me know if you want to improve this on Github!

Cheers,
