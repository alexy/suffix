In Intseq, I mimic string as int array, with append of an int to the end implemented
via append a [e].  The question is, what is the performance of this as compared to string ^ ?
Would Dynarray, or Bigarray, or some other array-like data structure be better for the large
observation sequences when building the generalized suffix tree?
