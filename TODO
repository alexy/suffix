++ create an .mli and separate specs there

And reuse in in body without duplication.
== RESOLVED: there's no way around duplication in ocaml right now!
Simply copied separated .mli back into .ml head.

-- performance: using Array 

In Intseq, I mimic string as int array, with append of an int to the end implemented
via append a [e].  The question is, what is the performance of this as compared to string ^ ?
Would Dynarray, or Bigarray, or some other array-like data structure be better for the large
observation sequences when building the generalized suffix tree?

-- constructors: improving on Intseq.of_array

Can we have a constuctor taking an array, like Seq [|...|] ?
